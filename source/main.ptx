    <chapter><title>Conformal maps and linear fractional transformations</title>
    <section>
        <title>Conformal maps</title>
        <p>Certain functions behave like little rigid rotations locally.
            <definition>
                A function <m>f: A \to B</m> is called <term>conformal</term> if for each <m>z_0 \in A</m>, <m>f</m> rotates tangent vectors to curves passing through <m>z_0</m> by a fixed angle <m>\theta</m> and stretches tangent vectors to curves by a fixed factor <m>r</m>.
            </definition>
        </p>

        <p>By way of example, consider the function <m>f(z) = z^2</m> at the point <m>z_0 = 1 + 1i = \sqrt{2}e^{i\pi/4}</m>. The horizontal line through <m>z_0</m> can be parametrized by <m>\gamma(t) = (1 + t) + 1i</m> which passes through <m>z_0</m> at <m>t = 1</m>. The tangent vector at <m>t = 1</m> is <m>\gamma\dd(0) = 1</m>. Now look at the image. Composing, we get
            <me>
                f(\gamma(t)) = (t + 1i)^2 = (t^2 - 1)  + 2ti.
            </me> 
        Then calculating the tangent vector to the image gives
            <me>
                f\dd(\gamma(t))|_{t = 1} = (2t + 2i)|_{t =1} = 2 + 2i.
            </me>
            That is, the tangent vector has increased in length by a factor of <m>2\sqrt{2}</m> and undergone a rotation of <m>\pi/4</m> radians. If we check the vertical line through <m>z_0</m>, which can be parametrized by <m>\gamma_2(t) = 1 + 1ti</m> where <m>\gamma_2(1) = z_0</m>, we find that the tangent vector <m>\gamma_2(1) = i</m> has image <m>f(\gamma_2(1)) = -2 + 2i</m>, which again represents an increase in magnitude of <m>2\sqrt{2}</m> and a rotation of <m>\pi/4</m> radians.
        </p>

        <p>There is a close connection between analytic maps and conformal maps.</p>
        <theorem>
            <p>Let <m>f: A \to B</m> be analytic and let <m>f^\prime(z_0) \neq 0</m> for all <m>z_0 \in A</m>. Then <m>f</m> is conformal.</p>.
        </theorem>
        <p>This is pretty straighforward to see via the chain rule. Let <m>\gamma(t)</m> be a (differentiable) path contained in <m>A</m> with <m>\gamma(0) = z_0</m>. Let <m>\sigma(t)</m> be the image of <m>\gamma</m> under <m>f</m> defined by <m>\sigma(t) = f(\gamma(t))</m>. Then the chain rule gives
        <me>
            \sigma\dd(t) = f\dd(\gamma(t)) \cdot \gamma\dd(t)
        </me>
        which in turn gives
        <me>
            \sigma\dd(0) = f\dd(z_0) \cdot \gamma\dd(0).
        </me>
        That is, if <m>f\dd(z_0) = r e^{i \theta}</m> the image of the derivative of any curve <m>\gamma</m> through <m>z_0</m> is rotated by <m>\theta</m> and stretched by <m>r</m>.
        </p>

        <p>Note that the condition that <m>f\dd(z_0) \neq 0</m> is necessary. For one, it obviously covers up the relationship between a curve and its image in the relation above. But the problem is deeper. Consider the function <m>f(z) = z^2</m>. Consider the lines that run along the <m>x-</m> and <m>y-</m>axis. These lines cross at a right angle at <m>z = 0</m>, but since both lines are mapped to the real axis under <m>f</m>, their images intersect at an angle of <m>\pi</m> radians. For this reason, points at which <m>f\dd(z_0) = 0</m> are called <term>singular</term> and do not correspond to points of local conformality.</p>

        <p>Much of the behavior of analytic functions should be thought about in small neighborhoods around points. The next theorem is one that you learn in first year calculus and describes the relationship between the derivative of a function and the derivative of its inverse (when that inverse exists). Analytic functions away from singular points are <em>locally invertible</em>.</p>

        <theorem><title>Inverse function theorem</title>
            <p>Let <m>f:A \to \C</m> be analytic and <m>f\dd(z_0) \neq 0</m> for <m>z_0 \in A</m>. Then there exists a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>z_0</m> and a neighborhood <m>V</m> of <m>f(z_0)</m> so that
            <ol>
                <li>the restriction <m>f:U \to V</m> is a bijection,</li>
                <li><m>f\inv:V \to U</m> is analytic,</li>
                <li>and 
                    <me> \frac{d}{dw} f\inv(w) = \frac{1}{f\dd(z)} </me>
                    where <m>w = f(z)</m>.
                </li>
            </ol>
            </p>
        </theorem>

        <p>The inverse function theorem will let us make more connections between conformal maps and their inverses.</p>

        <proposition>
            <p>If a map <m>f:A \to B</m> is conformal and bijective, then <m>f\inv:B \to A</m> is conformal and bijective.</p>
        </proposition>
        <proof>
            <p>Because <m>f</m> is bijective, <m>f\inv</m> exists. Because <m>f</m> is conformal, for any <m>z \in A</m>, we must have <m>f\dd(z) \neq 0</m>. Then the inverse function theorem gives that <m>f\inv</m> is analytic and
            <me> \frac{d}{dw} f\inv(w) = \frac{1}{f\dd(z)} \neq 0, </me>
            and so <m>f\inv</m> is also conformal.</p>
        </proof>

        <proposition>
            <p>If <m>f:A \to B</m> is conformal and bijective and <m>g: B \to C</m> is conformal and bijective, then <m> g\circ f</m> is conformal and bijective.</p>
        </proposition>
        <proof>
            <p>This is an immediate consequence of the chain rule.</p>
        </proof>

        <p>Because conformality is preserved by inverses and composition, we have the structure necessary to impose ideas from algebra on the family of conformal maps if we can make the functions compatible. An <term>automorphism</term> is a bijection from a set onto itself.</p>

        <theorem>
            <p>The set of bijective conformal maps from a domain <m>A</m> to itself (that is, the set of conformal automorphisms of <m>A</m>) is a group, where the group operation is composition of functions.</p>
        </theorem>

        <p>As part of our study of conformal maps, we're going to be looking a special family of automorphisms defined on the unit disk <m>\D</m>, but that's for later!</p>

        <p>A typical use of bijective conformal maps is to change problems in one domain to problems in a different domain. It might not be obvious why, but frequently we can use tools in one domain that might not be available in another. Because bijective conformal maps preserve information about paths, solving a problem in one domain can be easily extended to a solution in a conformal relative.</p>

        <definition>
            <p> Two domains <m>A, B \subset \C</m> are called <term>conformally equivalent</term> if there is a bijective conformal map <m>f: A \to B</m>.</p>
        </definition>

        <theorem>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be a simply connected domain that isn't all of <m>\C</m>. Then there exists a bijective conformal map <m>f: A \to \D</m>. Futher, for any fixed <m>z_0 \in A</m>, we can find <m>f</m> so that <m>f(z_0) = 0</m> and <m>f\dd(z_0) > 0</m>. With these conditions, the map <m>f</m> is unique.</p>
        </theorem>

        <p>There is a pretty easy but very striking corollary.</p>

        <corollary> 
            <p>Any two simply connected domains, neither of which is all of <m>\C</m>, are conformally equivalent.</p>
        </corollary>

        <p>Of course there are some annoyances here: we have no clue how to actually find the maps! We also don't know what happens at the boundary of the domains in the general case. Our next steps will be to address these questions.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <title> Simply connected sets, boundaries, and the Riemann mapping theorem</title>
        <p>
            Before we go on, we're going to need to deal with the issue that analytic maps don't always act nicely on the boundaries of their domains. (Remember, analytic and holomorphic are local properties defined on open sets, and the <q>edge</q> of a set isn't open.) Let us recall that a set is called <term>simply connected</term> if it <q>has no holes in it</q>. This intuitive idea of no holes corresponds to the rigorous notion a simply connected set is one in which every simple closed curve can be continuously deformed into a point without leaving the set. The act of continuously deforming a curve within a set is called <term>homotopy</term>. Two curves are said to be <term>homotopic</term> if we can find a homotopy from one curve to the other. More precisely, a homotopy in a domain <m>A</m> from a curve <m>\gamma_1</m> to a a curve <m>\gamma_2</m> is a continuous function <m>H(s, t)</m> where <m>H(s, t) \subset A</m> for all <m>s \in [0,1]</m>, and the endpoints have <m>H(0,t) = \gamma_1(t)</m>, and <m>H(1, t) = \gamma_2(t)</m>.
        </p>

        <p>Two domains <m>A, B \subset \C</m> are said to be <term>conformally equivalent</term> if there exists a bijective conformal map <m>f: A \to B</m>. The next theorem characterizes which sets are conformally equivalent to simply connected sets.</p>

        <theorem>
            <title>Riemann Mapping Theorem</title>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be a simply connected domain in <m>\C</m> with <m>A \neq \C</m>. Then there exists a bijective conformal map <m>f: A \to \D</m>, where <m>\D</m> is the complex unit disk. For any fixed <m>z_0 \in A</m>, we can find a unique such <m>f</m> so that <m>f(z_0) = 0</m> and <m>f\dd(z_0) > 0</m>.</p>
        </theorem>

        <p>Because the maps in the theorem above are bijections, we get a striking immediate corollary.</p>

        <corollary>
            <p>Any two simply connected regions, neither one of which is all of <m>\C</m>, are conformally equivalent.</p>
        </corollary>

        <p>This is a powerful fact! Unfortunately, this theorem doesn't tell us how to fund the conformal maps that connect different sets. We'll take a deeper dive into that in the next couple of lectures.</p>

        <p>Now, we'll turn to the question of what happens to the boundaries of domains under conformal maps. One way to think of the boundary of a domain <m>A</m> in <m>\C</m> is the set of points that can be reached as limits of sequences in <m>A</m>. Another is to think of it as the set of points for which any neighborhood contains points in <m>A</m> and points outside of <m>A</m>. We use the notation <m>\partial A</m> to indicated the boundary of <m>A</m>. Because domains in <m>\C</m> are open, a set and its boundary are disjoint. The <term>closure</term> of a domain <m>A</m> is <m>A \cup \partial A</m> and will be denoted <m>cl(A)</m> (we can also use <m>\cc{A}</m>, but to avoid confusion with the complex conjugate, we'll avoid that in these notes).</p>

        <proposition>
            <p>Let <m>A, B</m> be domains in <m>\C</m> with boundaries <m>\partial A, \partial B</m>. Suppose that <m>f: A \to f(A)</m> is conformal (that is, <m>f</m> is conformal from its domain to its range). If <m>f(A)</m> has boundary <m>\partial B</m> and additionally <m>f(z_0) \in B</m> for some <m>z_0 \in A</m>, then <m>f(A) = f(B)</m>.</p>
        </proposition>

        <p>Essentially, the previous proposition implies that we can find the image of a conformal map by computing the image of the boundary and keeping track of where the interior of the domain was mapped via a single point.</p>

        <p>We now come to the question of when a conformal map between domains can be extended to the boundary. Note that this extension will be a <em>continuous</em> extension, not an analytic one, because we can't work on neighborhoods for points in the boundary. For nice sets, conformal maps do indeed extend to the boundary.</p>

        <theorem>
            <p>Suppose that <m>A, B</m> are bounded, simply connected regions with boundaries <m>\partial A</m> and <m>\partial B</m> that are simple, continuous, closed curves (these are sometimes called Jordan curves). Then any conformal map of <m>A</m> that is one-to-one onto <m>B</m> can be extended to a continuous map of <m>A \cup \partial A</m> one-to-one onto <m>B \cup \partial B</m>.</p>
        </theorem>

        <question>
            <p>Find a bijective conformal map that takes a bounded region to an unbounded region. Show that there is no bijective conformal map from a simply connected domain to a non-simply connected domain.</p>
        </question> 
    </section>

    <section>
        <title>(optional) A proof of the Riemann Mapping Theorem</title>
        <p>The Riemann Mapping Theorem asserts that a simply connected domain <m>A</m> is conformally equilvalent to the complex unit disk <m>\D</m>. To prove this is going to take a bit of work, so roll up your sleeves! We'll proceed in pieces.</p>

        <p>A sequence of functions <m>f_n</m> is said to be <term>locally uniformly bounded</term> on a domain <m>A</m> if, for any <m>z_0 \in A</m>, there exists a neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>z_0</m> and a constant <m>M</m> so that <m>\abs{f_n} \lt M</m> on <m>U</m> for all <m>n</m>. Equivalently, a sequence of functions is locally uniformly bounded if the family of functions is uniformly bounded on each compact subset of the domain.</p>

        <theorem><title>Stieljes-Osgood Theorem</title>
            <p>A locally uniformly bounded sequences of holomorphic functions on a domain <m>A \subset \C</m>, has a locally uniformly convergent subsequence.</p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>Let <m>A</m> be the domain of the sequence of locally uniformly bounded functions <m>\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty</m>.</p>

            <p>It is enough to show that for each closed disk <m>D</m> in <m>A</m> that the sequence <m>f_n</m> converges uniformly on <m>D</m>. Suppose we could do so. Then we could take a countable cover of <m>A</m> by open disks whose closures <m>cl(D_k) \subset A</m> (say by using points with rational real and imaginary parts as centers), which can be arranged into a sequence <m>\{D_k\}</m>. Then by supposition, the sequence <m>f_n</m> has a subsequence <m>f_{1,n}</m> converging uniformly on <m>D_1</m>. Applying the same argument to <m>f_{1,n}</m> on <m>D_2</m> gives a subsequence converging uniformly on <m>D_2</m> (and <m>D_1</m>). Proceed inductively. The sequence <m>f_{k,n}</m> will be a subsequence of every previous subsequence, including <m>f_{n}</m>. Now take the sequence of elements <m>f_{n,n}</m>. It is a subsequence of <m>f_n</m> and it is locally uniformly convergent in <m>A</m>. (This is a form of a <q>diagonal</q> argument, ala Cantor.)</p>

            <p>We can reduce the problem even further. Consider one of the disks, say <m>D_k</m>. Because <m>cl(D_k)</m> is a subset of then open set <m>A</m>, it is contained in an open disk <m>U</m> also contained in <m>A</m> and with <m>cl(U) \subset A</m> on which <m>f_n</m> is uniformly bounded.</p>
        </proof>

    <section>
        <title>Interlude: Liouville's Theorem</title>
        <p>In the calculus of real functions, it isn't at all unusual to deal with power series that converge everywhere in <m>\R</m> that represent bounded functions. (A whole class of these in the real world are signals that can be expressed as Fourier series). For example, <m>f(x) = \sin x</m> has a power series representation valid for all real <m>x</m> and it bounded in absolute value by 1. The extension theorem tells us that this same series should have infinite radius of convergence on <m>\C</m> as well, but we should note what happens to the size of the values of the function. Let <m> z = x + iy</m>. Then
        <me>
            f(z) = \sin z = \frac{1}{2i} (e^{iz} - e^{-iz}),
        </me>
        and
        <me>
            e^{iz} = e^{ix - y} = e^{ix} e^{-y}
        </me>
        which will be unbounded as we let <m>y \to -\infty</m>. So even though <m>\sin z</m> remains a function with a convergent power series representation on <m>\C</m> (a so-called <term>entire</term> function), it is an unbounded function. Liouville's theorem asserts that this is the general situation - an entire function that is bounded must necessarily be a constant function.</p>

        <p>The proof of Liouville's theorem follows from a useful set of estimates about the behavior of derivatives of bounded analytic functions called the Cauchy inequalities. First, recall that Cauchy's integral theorem for derivatives gives
            <me>
                f^{n}(z_0) = \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \oint_C \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz
            </me>
            where <m>C</m> is a simple closed curve about <m>z_0</m> inside the domain of <m>f</m>.</p>

        <theorem>
            <title>Cauchy inequalities</title>
            <p>Let <m>f</m> be an analytic function on a domain <m>A</m> with bound <m>\abs{f(z)} \lt M</m> on <m>A</m>, and let <m>\gamma</m> be a circle of radius <m>R</m> centered at a point <m>z_0 \in A</m> with <m>\gamma \subset A</m>. Then
            <me>
                \abs{f^{n}(z_0)} \leq \frac{n!}{R^n} M.
            </me></p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>Suppose that <m>\gamma(t) = z_0 + R e^{it}</m> parametrizes <m>\gamma</m>. Note that restricted to <m>\gamma</m>, we have <m>z - z_0 = R</m>.  By the integral theorem for derivatives,  we have
            <md>
                <mrow> \abs{f^{n}(z_0)} \amp= | \frac{n!}{2\pi i} \oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz |</mrow> 
                <mrow>\amp= \frac{n!}{2\pi} |\oint_\gamma \frac{f(z)}{(z - z_0)^{n+1}} \, dz|</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp\leq \frac{n!}{2\pi} \frac{M}{R^{n+1}} 2 \pi R,</mrow>
                <mrow>\amp= \frac{n!}{R^n}M</mrow>
            </md>
            where the inequality follows from the ML-inequality.</p>
        </proof>

        <p>We're now ready for the main result of this section</p>

        <theorem>
            <title>Liouville's Theorem</title>
            <p>A bounded entire function is necessarily constant.</p>
        </theorem>

        <proof>
            <p>Let <m>z_0</m> be a complex number and let <m>\gamma</m> be a circle of radius <m>R</m> centered at <m>z_0</m>. Suppose that <m>f</m> is bounded in modulus on <m>\C</m> by a constant <m>M</m>. Now apply the Cauchy inequality with <m>n = 1</m> to <m>f</m> at <m>z_0</m>. This gives
            <me>
                |f\dd(z_0)| \leq \frac{M}{R}.
            </me>
            This inequality holds for all radii <m>R</m>, because every circle centered at <m>z_0</m> is contained in the domain of <m>f</m>. In particular, this means that as we let <m>R \to \infty</m>, we have
            <me>
                |f\dd(z_0)| = 0,
            </me>
            which means that <m>f\dd(z_0) = 0</m>. Since this holds for every <m>z_0 \in \C</m>, we have <m>f\dd(z) = 0</m> and so <m>f(z) = c</m> for some constant <m>c \in \C</m>.</p>
        </proof>

        <title>Linear fractional tranformations</title>
        <p>A couple of you have asked me how to actually find the conformal maps that are guaranteed to exist by the Riemann Mapping Theorem. For a large class of domains, we can readily (for some value of readily) find these!</p>

        <definition>
            <p>A <term>linear fractional transformation</term> is a degree one complex rational function of the form
            <me>
                T(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}
            </me>
            for fixed constants <m>a, b, c, d \in \C</m>, and where we assume that <m>ad - bc \neq 0</m>.</p>
        </definition>

        <question>
            <p>What happens to <m>T</m> if <m>ad - bc \neq 0</m>?</p>
        </question>

        <p>We will use the shorthand LFT to stand for linear fractional transformation. From what we learned last term, it should be immediately obvious that an LFT has one pole of order 1 where <m>cz + d = 0</m>.</p>

         <p>LFTs are the basic building blocks of conformal maps.</p>

         <proposition xml:id="prop-lft">
            <p>Let 
                <me>
                    T(z) = \frac{az + b}{cz + d}.
                </me>
            Then <m>T</m> is bijective and conformal from <m>A = \{z: cz + d \neq 0\}</m> to <m>B = \{w: cw + d \neq 0\}</m>.</p>
            <p>The inverse function <m>T\inv:B \to A</m> is also a linear fractional tranformation with formula
                <me>
                    T\inv(w) = \frac{-dw + b}{cw - a}.
                </me></p>
        </proposition>

        <proof>
            <p>Let <m>S = \frac{-dw + b}{cw - a}</m>. The domain <m>A</m> excludes the simple pole of <m>T</m>, and likewise for <m>B</m> and <m>S</m>, which means that <m>T, S</m> are analytic on <m>A, B</m> respectively. So the argument comes down to showing that these functions are inverses, which can be done by direct computation. We will need the fact that <m>cw - a \neq 0</m> on <m>B</m> and that <m>bc - ad \neq 0</m> by definition. We leave to the reader the computation that
            <me>
                T(S(w)) = w
            </me>
            and
            <me>
                S(T(z)) = z
            </me>.
            Finally,
            <me>
                1 = \frac{d}{dz}(z) = \frac{d}{dz} (S(T(z))) = S\dd(T(z)) \cdot T\dd(z),
            </me>
            which implies that <m>T\dd(z) \neq 0.</m></p>
        </proof>

        <p>We leave a little hook for the future here - we can <q>complete</q> the function by assigning the value <m>T(-d/c) = \infty</m>, which will turn out, which a little caution, to give us a conformal bijection of the Riemann sphere to itself. We'll arrive at the Riemann sphere in the next section.</p>

        <p>What sort of functions are in the class of LFTs? If <m>a = 1, c = 0, d=0</m>, we get the translation function <m>T(z) = z + b</m>. If <m>b = c = 0</m> and <m>d = 1</m>, then we get <m>T(z) = az</m>, which should be viewed as <m>T(z) = re^{i\theta}z</m> which is a rotation by <m>\theta</m> and a magnification by <m>r</m>. Finally, if <m>b=c=1</m> and <m>a=d=0</m>, we get the inversion function <m>T(z) = \frac{1}{z}</m>.</p>

        <p>We noted that the conformal automorphisms of the unit disk form a group - let us characterize these functions.</p>

        <proposition>
            <p>A conformal automorphism of the unit disk <m>\D</m> is a linear fractional transformation of the form
            <men xml:id="eq-diskLFT">
                T(z) = e^{i\theta} \frac{z - \alpha}{1 - \cc\alpha z}
            </men>
            for a fixed angle <m>\theta \in [0, 2\pi)</m> and a fixed <m>\alpha \in \D</m>. Moreover, any <m>T</m> of this form is a conformal automorphism of <m>\D</m>.</p>
        </proposition>

        <proof>
            <p>We'll start by showing that maps of the form of <m>T</m> map the unit circle into itself. First, assume that <m>\abs{z} = 1</m>. Then
            <me>
                \abs{T(z)} = \abs{\frac{z - \alpha}{1 - \cc\alpha z}} = \frac{1}{\abs{z}} \abs{\frac{z - \alpha}{z\inv - \cc\alpha}}.
            </me>
            Because <m>\abs{z} = 1</m>, we also have that <m>z\inv = \cc z</m>, which gives
            <me>
                \abs{T(z)} = \frac{\abs{z - \alpha}}{\abs{\cc z - \cc \alpha}} = 1.
            </me>
            Hence, <m>T(\T) \subset \T</m>. Now, note that <m>T</m> has only a singularity at <m>z = \frac{1}{\cc\alpha}</m>, which is outside the unit circle, so <m>T</m> is analytic in a neighborhood of <m>\D</m>. Then by the maximium modulus principle, for any <m>z\in \D</m>, we must have <m>\abs{T(z)} \lt 1</m>, which implies that <m>T:\D \to \D</m>. Also, by <xref ref="prop-lft"/>, <m>T\inv</m> has the same form, and so also defines a conformal map from <m>\D \to \D</m>. Thus any such <m>T</m> is a conformal automorphism from <m>\D \to \D</m>.</p>

            <p>Now, let's show that any conformal automorphism from <m>\D \to \D</m> must be of this form. We'll be using uniqueness of conformal maps. Assume that <m>R:\D \to \D</m> is a conformal automorphism. Let <m>\alpha = R\inv(0)</m>, and let <m>\theta = \operatorname{arg} R\dd(z_0)</m>. A map <m>T</m> of the form <xref ref="eq-diskLFT"/> also has <m>T(\alpha) = 0</m>. Further, if we compute the derivative of <m>T</m> at <m>\alpha</m>, we'll get
            <me>
                T\dd(\alpha) =e^{i\theta} \frac{1}{1 - \abs{\alpha}^2}
            </me>,
            which has argument <m>\operatorname{arg} T\dd(\alpha) = \theta</m>. Thus, <m>R</m> and <m>T</m> agree in value and argument at <m>\alpha</m>, and so by uniquess of conformal maps, <m>R = T</m>. (note: the argument version of uniqueness follows from the positive derivative version. add this to a future draft or add as exercise.) </p>
        </proof>

        <p>Let <m>\hat\C</m> denote the extended complex plane. If we think of lines as passing through the unique point at <m>\infty</m> in either direction, then lines are essentially circles in <m>\hat\C</m>. Equivalently, lines map to great circles passing through the north pole in the Riemann sphere model. Linear fractional transforms on <m>\hat\C</m> send circles to circles with this identification for lines.</p>

        <proposition>
            <p>Let <m>T</m> be a linear fractional transformation. If <m>L \subset \C</m> is a line and <m>S \subset \C</m> is a circle, then <m>T(L)</m> is a line or a circle, and <m>T(S)</m> is a line or a circle.</p>
        </proposition>

        <p>Some authors use the amusingly awful word <q>clircle</q> to include both cases. We'll be more dignified and just say <q>circle</q> when we're referring to these shapes in the extended plane or sphere.</p>

        <p>Now suppose that we are given three points in <m>\C</m>. If these are collinear, the three points determine a unique line. If they are not collinear, they determine a unique circle. Because LFTs take circles/lines to circles lines, we might suspect that the implication of the geometric fact above is that there is a unique linear fractional map carrying any set <m>z_1, z_2, z_3 \in \C</m> to the set <m>w_1, w_2, w_3 \in \C</m>, and this is indeed the case.</p>

        <proposition>
            <p>Given two sets of distinct points <m>z_1, z_2, z_3</m> and <m>w_1, w_2, w_3</m>, there is a unique LFT with <m>T(z_i) = w_i</m> for <m>i = 1, 2, 3</m>. Moreover, if <m>T(z) = w</m> then
            <me>
                \frac{w - w_1}{w - w_2} \cdot \frac{w_3 - w_2}{w_3 - w_1} = \frac{z - z_1}{z - z_2}\cdot\frac{z_3 - z_2}{z_3 - z_1}.
            </me></p>
