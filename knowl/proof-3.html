<p>Let <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> be the domain of the sequence of locally uniformly bounded functions <span class="process-math">\(\{f_n\}_{n=1}^\infty\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>It is enough to show that for each closed disk <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> that the sequence <span class="process-math">\(f_n\)</span> converges uniformly on <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span> Suppose we could do so. Then we could take a countable cover of <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> by open disks whose closures <span class="process-math">\(cl(D_k) \subset A\)</span> (say by using points with rational real and imaginary parts as centers), which can be arranged into a sequence <span class="process-math">\(\{D_k\}\text{.}\)</span> Then by supposition, the sequence <span class="process-math">\(f_n\)</span> has a subsequence <span class="process-math">\(f_{1,n}\)</span> converging uniformly on <span class="process-math">\(D_1\text{.}\)</span> Applying the same argument to <span class="process-math">\(f_{1,n}\)</span> on <span class="process-math">\(D_2\)</span> gives a subsequence converging uniformly on <span class="process-math">\(D_2\)</span> (and <span class="process-math">\(D_1\)</span>). Proceed inductively. The sequence <span class="process-math">\(f_{k,n}\)</span> will be a subsequence of every previous subsequence, including <span class="process-math">\(f_{n}\text{.}\)</span> Now take the sequence of elements <span class="process-math">\(f_{n,n}\text{.}\)</span> It is a subsequence of <span class="process-math">\(f_n\)</span> and it is locally uniformly convergent in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> (This is a form of a “diagonal” argument, ala Cantor.)</p>
<p>We can reduce the problem even further. Consider one of the disks, say <span class="process-math">\(D_k\text{.}\)</span> Because <span class="process-math">\(cl(D_k)\)</span> is a subset of then open set <span class="process-math">\(A\text{,}\)</span> it is contained in an open disk <span class="process-math">\(U\)</span> also contained in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and with <span class="process-math">\(cl(U) \subset A\)</span> on which <span class="process-math">\(f_n\)</span> is uniformly bounded.</p></article><span class="incontext"><a href="section-3.html#proof-3">in-context</a></span>
