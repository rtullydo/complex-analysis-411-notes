<div class="para">Note that the condition that <span class="process-math">\(f\dd(z_0) \neq 0\)</span> is necessary. For one, it obviously covers up the relationship between a curve and its image in the relation above. But the problem is deeper. Consider the function <span class="process-math">\(f(z) = z^2\text{.}\)</span> Consider the lines that run along the <span class="process-math">\(x-\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(y-\)</span>axis. These lines cross at a right angle at <span class="process-math">\(z = 0\text{,}\)</span> but since both lines are mapped to the real axis under <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> their images intersect at an angle of <span class="process-math">\(\pi\)</span> radians. For this reason, points at which <span class="process-math">\(f\dd(z_0) = 0\)</span> are called <dfn class="terminology">singular</dfn> and do not correspond to points of local conformality.</div>
