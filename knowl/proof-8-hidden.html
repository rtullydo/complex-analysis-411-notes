<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>In the case where <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a line, the argument follows from basic geometry, and <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{z}\)</span> is the point on the line perpendicular to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> passing through <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> and equidistant to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>If <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a circle, then the interior of <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is a disk, and we can conformally map this disk with a LFT <span class="process-math">\(T\)</span> to the upper half plane, with the circle mapping to the real line (why?). Now the family of circles passing through <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> and orthogonal to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> continue to pass through the point <span class="process-math">\(w = T(z)\)</span> and remain orthogonal to the image of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> By the line case, these circles must also pass through the reflection <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{w}\text{.}\)</span> Finally, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(T\inv(\tilde{w}) = \tilde{z}\)</span> is the reflection of <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span></p></article></body>
