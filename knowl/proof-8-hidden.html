Now the family of circles passing through <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> and orthogonal to <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> continue to pass through the point <span class="process-math">\(w = T(z)\)</span> and remain orthogonal to the image of <span class="process-math">\(C\text{.}\)</span> By the line case, these circles must also pass through the reflection <span class="process-math">\(\tilde{w}\text{.}\)</span> Finally, we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(T\inv(\tilde{w}) = \tilde{z}\)</span> is the reflection of <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span>
