<p>There is useful geometry connecting potentials and their gradient fields. Recall that a <dfn class="terminology">level curve</dfn> for <span class="process-math">\(u\)</span> is the set of points <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \in A\)</span> with <span class="process-math">\(u(x,y) = C\)</span> for constants <span class="process-math">\(C \in \R\text{.}\)</span> Given that the gradient vectors measure the direction of greatest change in a scalar field, it shouldn't be surprising that the gradient vector at a point in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is orthogonal to the level curve through the point. If the vector field varies continuously, we might expect that we can trace <dfn class="terminology">flow lines</dfn> through <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> A flow line (say parametrized by <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span>) should have the property that at every point <span class="process-math">\((x,y) \in A\text{,}\)</span> <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\dd(t) = \nabla u(x,y)\text{.}\)</span> Typically, the problem of computing flows lines explicitly is hard. However, for certain functions <span class="process-math">\(u\text{,}\)</span> this problem turns out to be much easier.</p>
