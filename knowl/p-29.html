<p>Now, we'll turn to the question of what happens to the boundaries of domains under conformal maps. One way to think of the boundary of a domain <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> is the set of points that can be reached as limits of sequences in <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Another is to think of it as the set of points for which any neighborhood contains points in <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> and points outside of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> We use the notation <span class="process-math">\(\partial A\)</span> to indicated the boundary of <span class="process-math">\(A\text{.}\)</span> Because domains in <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> are open, a set and its boundary are disjoint. The <dfn class="terminology">closure</dfn> of a domain <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> is <span class="process-math">\(A \cup \partial A\)</span> and will be denoted <span class="process-math">\(cl(A)\)</span> (we can also use <span class="process-math">\(\cc{A}\text{,}\)</span> but to avoid confusion with the complex conjugate, we'll avoid that in these notes).</p>
