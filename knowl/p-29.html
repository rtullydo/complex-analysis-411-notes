<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Now, we'll turn to the question of what happens to the boundaries of domains under conformal maps. One way to think of the boundary of a domain \(A\) in \(\C\) is the set of points that can be reached as limits of sequences in \(A\text{.}\) Another is to think of it as the set of points for which any neighborhood contains points in \(A\) and points outside of \(A\text{.}\) We use the notation \(\partial A\) to indicated the boundary of \(A\text{.}\) Because domains in \(\C\) are open, a set and its boundary are disjoint. The <dfn class="terminology">closure</dfn> of a domain \(A\) is \(A \cup \partial A\) and will be denoted \(cl(A)\) (we can also use \(\cc{A}\text{,}\) but to avoid confusion with the complex conjugate, we'll avoid that in these notes).</p>
