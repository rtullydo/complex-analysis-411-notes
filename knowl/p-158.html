<div class="para">One important example of a measure is <dfn class="terminology">Lebesgue measure</dfn>, which directly generalizes the length of intervals. Lebesgue measure is usually defined on the Borel sets <span class="process-math">\(\mathcal B\text{,}\)</span> which is the <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra constructed by starting with the open intervals in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> and combining them in all ways to ensure that the conditions for a <span class="process-math">\(\sigma\)</span>-algebra are met. Measures can be far stranger than Lebesgue measure. The Dirac measure at <span class="process-math">\(x_0\text{,}\)</span> also called a point mass, is a measure that assigns a value of 1 to any set <span class="process-math">\(E\)</span> containing <span class="process-math">\(x_0\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> otherwise.</div>
