<p>In the calculus of real functions, it isn't at all unusual to deal with power series that converge everywhere in <span class="process-math">\(\R\)</span> that represent bounded functions. (A whole class of these in the real world are signals that can be expressed as Fourier series). For example, <span class="process-math">\(f(x) = \sin x\)</span> has a power series representation valid for all real <span class="process-math">\(x\)</span> and it bounded in absolute value by 1. The extension theorem tells us that this same series should have infinite radius of convergence on <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> as well, but we should note what happens to the size of the values of the function. Let <span class="process-math">\(z = x + iy\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
f(z) = \sin z = \frac{1}{2i} (e^{iz} - e^{-iz}),
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">and</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
e^{iz} = e^{ix - y} = e^{ix} e^{-y}
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which will be unbounded as we let <span class="process-math">\(y \to -\infty\text{.}\)</span> So even though <span class="process-math">\(\sin z\)</span> remains a function with a convergent power series representation on <span class="process-math">\(\C\)</span> (a so-called <dfn class="terminology">entire</dfn> function), it is an unbounded function. Liouville's theorem asserts that this is the general situation - an entire function that is bounded must necessarily be a constant function.</p>
