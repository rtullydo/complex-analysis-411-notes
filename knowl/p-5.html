<p xmlns:svg="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">Note that the condition that \(f\d(z_0) \neq 0\) is necessary. For one, it obviously covers up the relationship between a curve and its image in the relation above. But the problem is deeper. Consider the function \(f(z) = z^2\text{.}\) Consider the lines that run along the \(x-\) and \(y-\)axis. These lines cross at a right angle at \(z = 0\text{,}\) but since both lines are mapped to the real axis under \(f\text{,}\) their images intersect at an angle of \(\pi\) radians. For this reason, points at which \(f\d(z_0) = 0\) are called <dfn class="terminology">singular</dfn> and do not correspond to points of local conformality.</p>
