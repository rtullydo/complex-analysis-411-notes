<p>Our first discussion is about where the zeros of <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\)</span> are. (Note that we're abusing notation and using <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\)</span> to represent the continuation of <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(\C\text{.}\)</span>) We can probe this using the functional equation. Remember that <span class="process-math">\(\Gamma\)</span> is a non-zero function with simple poles at <span class="process-math">\(0\)</span> and the negative integers. <span class="process-math">\(\sin \frac{\pi s}{2}\)</span> has simple zeros at all even integers, and we know that <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\)</span> has only one pole, at <span class="process-math">\(s=1\text{.}\)</span> So consider the product</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\sin \frac{\pi s}{2} \Gamma(1-s) \zeta(1-s).
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">The poles of <span class="process-math">\(\Gamma(1-s)\text{,}\)</span> which happen when <span class="process-math">\(1 - s = 0, -1, -2, \ldots\)</span> or <span class="process-math">\(s = 1, 2, 3, 4, \ldots\)</span> are being canceled into removable singularities by corresponding zeros in the product, with the exception of <span class="process-math">\(s = 1\text{.}\)</span> The poles at the even values of <span class="process-math">\(s\)</span> are being eaten by the simple zeros of <span class="process-math">\(\sin \frac{\pi s}{2}\text{,}\)</span> which leaves poles at <span class="process-math">\(s = 3, 5, 7, \ldots\)</span> that must be canceled by <span class="process-math">\(\zeta(1-s)\text{.}\)</span> But this forces <span class="process-math">\(\zeta(1-s)\)</span> to have simple zeros at <span class="process-math">\(s = 3, 5, 7, \ldots\text{,}\)</span> which corresponds to <span class="process-math">\(\zeta(s)\)</span> possessing simple zeros at <span class="process-math">\(s = -2, -4, -6, \ldots\text{.}\)</span> These are called the <dfn class="terminology">trivial zeros</dfn> of <span class="process-math">\(\zeta\text{.}\)</span></p>
