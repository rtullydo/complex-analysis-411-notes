<p>Our first proof of the prime number theorem will run through a complex analytic argument due to Newman. The particular paper I'm referencing here is "Newman's short proof of the prime number theorem", by D. Zagler, which appeared in the American Mathematical Monthly. Tao's notes follow a similar line, but works through a different set of functions. We aim to prove the following description of the asymptotic density of the primes in the integers. Let <span class="process-math">\(\pi(x)\)</span> denote the number of primes less than or equal to <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> We will use the notation <span class="process-math">\(f \sim g\)</span> (that is, <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(g\)</span> are asymptotically equal) to mean <span class="process-math">\(\lim_{x \to \infty} f(x)/g(x) = 1\text{.}\)</span> We will also use the order notation <span class="process-math">\(g = \mathrm{O}(f)\)</span> as <span class="process-math">\(x \to \infty\)</span> to mean that there exists some <span class="process-math">\(C&gt;0\)</span> so that <span class="process-math">\(\abs{g(x)} \leq Cf(x)\)</span> for all sufficiently large <span class="process-math">\(x\text{.}\)</span> (Every order argument we make in this section will be at infinity, so we may sometimes just write <span class="process-math">\(g = \mathrm{O}(x)\text{.}\)</span>)</p>
