<body class="ignore-math"><article class="hiddenproof"><p>Assume without loss of generality that the domain <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> is connected (and so path-connected). Assume that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> satisifies the hypotheses of the theorem. We will construct an anti-derivative for <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> which will allow us to conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is analytic.</p>
<p>Pick a basepoint <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> and for any other <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> in <span class="process-math">\(D\text{,}\)</span> let <span class="process-math">\(\gamma\)</span> be a simple path from <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> Let <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> be the function on <span class="process-math">\(D\)</span> given by</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
F(z) = \int_\gamma f(\xi) \, d\xi.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>Note that this definition does not depend on the choice of path. Assume that <span class="process-math">\(\tau\)</span> is another path from <span class="process-math">\(z_0\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z\text{.}\)</span> Then, by hypothesis,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
0 \amp= \oint_{\tau\inv \gamma} f\\
\amp = \oint_{\tau\inv} f + \oint_\gamma f\\
\amp = -\oint_{\tau} f + \oint_\gamma f
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">which implies that <span class="process-math">\(\oint_\tau f = \oint_\gamma f\text{.}\)</span></p>
<p>Note futher that a different choice of basepoint (say <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span>) causes the resulting function to differ from <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> only by the constant <span class="process-math">\(C = \oint_C f\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(C\)</span> is any simple path from <span class="process-math">\(z_1\)</span> to <span class="process-math">\(z_0\text{.}\)</span> Thus, choice of basepoint does not affect the derivative.</p>
<p>It remains to show that <span class="process-math">\(\frac{d}{dz} F(z) = f(z)\text{.}\)</span> This boils down to a difference quotient argument. Consider <span class="process-math">\(F(z + h)\)</span> for some small complex number <span class="process-math">\(h\text{.}\)</span> Then</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
F(z+h) - F(z) = \int_{z_0}^{z+h} f(\xi) \, d\xi - \int_{z_0}^z f(\xi) \, d\xi = \int_z^{z+h} f(\xi) \, d\xi.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">(The notation is justified by the path independence of integrals of <span class="process-math">\(f\text{.}\)</span>)  Now,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{h} (F(z + h) - F(z)) - f(z) \amp= \frac{1}{h} (F(z + h) - F(z)) - \frac{1}{h} hf(z) \\
\amp = \frac{1}{h} (\int_z^{z + h} f(\xi) \, d\xi - h f(z))\\
\amp = \frac{1}{h} (\int_z^{z + h} f(\xi) \, d\xi - \int_z^{z+h} f(z) \, d\xi)\\
\amp= \frac{1}{h} \int_z^{z+h} f(\xi) - f(z) \, d\xi.
\end{align*}
</div>
<p class="continuation">Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> has path independent line integrals, choose the line segment between <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(z + h\text{.}\)</span> Since <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is continuous,</p>
<div class="displaymath process-math">
\begin{equation*}
\abs{\frac{F(z + h) - F(z)}{h} - f(z)} \leq \frac{1}{h} \int_z^{z+h} \abs{f(\xi) - f(z)} \, d\xi \to 0 \text{ as } \abs{h} \to 0.
\end{equation*}
</div>
<p>We conclude that <span class="process-math">\(F\)</span> is differentiable at <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> and thus analytic at <span class="process-math">\(z\)</span> with derivative <span class="process-math">\(f\text{,}\)</span> which implies that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is analytic. Since this holds for all <span class="process-math">\(z\in D\text{,}\)</span> we conclude that <span class="process-math">\(f\)</span> is analytic on <span class="process-math">\(D\text{.}\)</span></p></article></body>
