<p>Before we go on, we're going to need to deal with the issue that analytic maps don't always act nicely on the boundaries of their domains. (Remember, analytic and holomorphic are local properties defined on open sets, and the “edge” of a set isn't open.) Let us recall that a set is called <dfn class="terminology">simply connected</dfn> if it “has no holes in it”. This intuitive idea of no holes corresponds to the rigorous notion a simply connected set is one in which every simple closed curve can be continuously deformed into a point without leaving the set. The act of continuously deforming a curve within a set is called <dfn class="terminology">homotopy</dfn>. Two curves are said to be <dfn class="terminology">homotopic</dfn> if we can find a homotopy from one curve to the other. More precisely, a homotopy in a domain <span class="process-math">\(A\)</span> from a curve <span class="process-math">\(\gamma_1\)</span> to a a curve <span class="process-math">\(\gamma_2\)</span> is a continuous function <span class="process-math">\(H(s, t)\)</span> where <span class="process-math">\(H(s, t) \subset A\)</span> for all <span class="process-math">\(s \in [0,1]\text{,}\)</span> and the endpoints have <span class="process-math">\(H(0,t) = \gamma_1(t)\text{,}\)</span> and <span class="process-math">\(H(1, t) = \gamma_2(t)\text{.}\)</span></p>
